# Computer Vision (Portfolio repository)
Besides the project on Deep MEtric Learning presented in a seperate repository, during the Computer Vision moudle we were challanged with writting two shorter (2400 words each) courseworks. First one considers: Camera Calibration and Epipolar Geometry. Second one is about Stereo Vision and Deep Learning.
